# Lab03: Sets and Recursion

1. Recursively generate the Fibonacci numbers up to and including 10 and add them to set R.

2. Generate a second set O of odd numbers from 1 to 100.

3. Create a set I that is the intersection of R and O by STL set_intersection.

4. Create a set U that is the union of the sets R and the first half of set O, you may not use STL set_union.

5. Print out each set, R, O, I and U.
